# Wangsa architecture

The desktop and terminal interfaces use the same task logic. A command is parsed
once, passed to the task service, saved if it changes data, and then shown to the user.

## Main classes

| Classes | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `gui.Main`, `Wangsa`, `Ui` | Desktop controls and terminal input/output |
| `Parser`, `Command` | Check command syntax and carry the parsed arguments |
| `TaskService` | Carry out commands and coordinate saving |
| `TaskList`, `TaskMatch` | Manage order, capacity, search, and task numbers |
| `Task`, `Todo`, `Deadline`, `Event`, `TaskType` | Represent tasks and their details |
| `TaskRepository` | Define the storage operations |
| `Storage` | Read, validate, and save tasks in a plain text file |
| `SaveLocation` | Keep downloaded users' saves beside the JAR |
| `gui.ChatMessage`, `gui.MessageIcon`, `gui.QuestIcon` | Render message bubbles and simple speaker symbols |
| `gui.TaskView`, `gui.TaskFormatter` | Lay out task rows and format their literal text |
| `gui.Typography` | Choose an installed font for readable desktop text |
| `CommandHelp`, `gui.HelpView`, `AiHelper` | Share command definitions, show grouped examples, and provide optional AI explanations |
| `gui.Launcher`, `gui.NativeLibraries` | Select the JavaFX native libraries before opening the window |

The interface draws its arrows and compass using JavaFX shapes. There are no
image or audio resources to load.
`gui.Typography` selects an installed font; it does not download or bundle fonts.
Message rows span the window, with Wangsa on the left and the user on the right.
Individual bubbles keep a maximum width so long lines stay readable.
`TaskView` uses a marker column for bullets or task numbers and a content column
for the status, description, and detail lines. Due dates and event times share
the title's left edge, without leading-space padding. Each reply is a snapshot,
so completing a task later does not change an earlier message.

## Input validation

`Parser` checks command names and required markers before creating a task.
For a deadline, `/by` is required; plain `by` is not a marker. `LocalDate` also
checks that the date exists, so `2026-09-31` is rejected even though its format
looks right. Validation happens before task changes or saving.

An invalid command produces an error reply, leaving existing tasks unchanged.
The user can type the corrected command into the same input box. Both Enter and
SEND use the same submission handler.

## Task changes and saving

`TaskList` holds up to 100 valid tasks. Search results keep the numbers used by
the full list. Sorting puts deadlines first and keeps equal-date or undated
tasks in their previous relative order.

`TaskService` reports success only after saving. If an add, mark, unmark, or sort
cannot be saved, it restores the previous in-memory state. A delete is saved
before it is applied to memory.

`Storage` writes the complete list to a temporary UTF-8 file in the save folder,
then replaces `wangsa.txt`. It uses an atomic move where supported, with a regular
replacement as a fallback. Each line records the type, completion flag, description,
and any date or event times. Separators, backslashes, and line breaks are escaped.

Loading validates every line and the 100-task limit. Invalid data is reported
with its line number and file path; it is not silently discarded. The desktop
keeps `help` and `bye` available if loading fails. The terminal exits.

The packaged app saves under its own folder, regardless of the terminal's current
folder. Source-code runs save under the project folder. Old database files are
not read, changed, or deleted.

## Optional AI help

`CommandHelp` holds immutable command groups used by the desktop, terminal, and
AI prompts. `HelpView` lays out those groups as responsive cards, without copying
command definitions into the GUI. `TaskFormatter` keeps readable desktop output
separate from the compact terminal and storage formats.
`AiHelper` sends only that reference and the current question to Groq. It cannot
access saved tasks or execute commands, and it keeps no conversation history.

The desktop runs one request at a time in a background thread; task commands
remain usable. The terminal waits for the response. Requests have a 20-second
timeout and no retries. Missing configuration, empty replies, or provider errors
return offline help. Raw provider errors are not displayed because they may
contain request details.

Tests supply a fake model, so they need no API key or network connection.

## Adding a feature

1. Update the task model if new data is needed.
2. Add syntax and validation in `Parser`, with a matching `Command` type.
3. Put shared behaviour in `TaskService`; use `TaskRepository` for storage.
4. Add tests for valid input, invalid input, and failed saving.
5. Add desktop and terminal output, then update the user guide.

A different storage backend can implement `TaskRepository` without changing the
task service. A new task type should extend `Task` and be supported by the parser
and storage adapter.
